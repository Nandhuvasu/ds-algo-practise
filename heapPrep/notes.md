## Heap

- Tree based Data Structure
- Two types:
  - Max heap
  - Min heap
- Max heap - root node's value is maximum of all its children. It is true for sub-trees too
- Min heap - root node's value is minimum of all its children; true for sub-trees too.

## Binary Heap
A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.
1) Itâ€™s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

2) A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap
